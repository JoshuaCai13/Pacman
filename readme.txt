        -Creative mode that enables user to place/remove obstacles, add additional 
        ghosts (for the round)

How to run the project:
    Make sure to have all the files in the zip file open. This means that every 
    image must be there. Additionally, there should be a leaderboard.txt file 
    present, which saves high scores. Given that all those files are there, there 
    is no need for any additional material.

Which libraries/modules you're using that need to be installed, if any:
    Only cmu_112_graphics and random.
